<h1>Good Enough Software</h1>
<h2>Why I Chose This Section</h2>
<p>I chose to write about this section because it addresses a <em>different</em> kind of problem than I usually think about,
  but certainly a valid problem, not only in programming, but also in other aspects of life.  I often times find myself caught up
  in the mindset that everything I do must be done perfectly that I spend too much time overthinking it.  I don't think I realized
   it before reading this section, but sometimes I overthink my hitting technique in baseball, a project in electronics, and of course,
   in my code.  This is good to an extent, but once I have these things to a level of good enough I can struggle to stop,
    which leads to a faulty adjustment being made.  A specific example was ladt semester on my electronics project I added
    in an extra step to the game I was making and it drew too much current, thus ruining the project (thankfully it was easy to undo).
  </p>
  <h2>How to Apply What I Learned</h2>
  <p>In the previously given example, adding an extra element to my game would have enhanced the project, however, given the
     two week time constraint, and the fact that I had already met the project requirements, it would have been wise of me to stop there.
     I should not risk ruining the project right ahead of the deadline when it already exceeds the requirements.  Not
     only would I be jeopordizing the project, but I am doing so at the expense of my own time for other projects as well as my
     stress levels.  I hope to learn not to leave my projects in the oven too long, so to say I need to learn when is best to stop.
     No one wants an incomplete project, but going too far can be equally as detrimental.</p>
